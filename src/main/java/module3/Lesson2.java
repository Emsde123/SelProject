        // MAVEN //
        // Your project needs to be independent.
        // The people using your project shouldn't have to figure out what JAR files to download so they can run your project.
        // Maven helps with this problem.

        // Maven is a build tool.
        // What is a build tool?
        // - Used to set up everything which is required to run your code independently.
        // - It generates source code, compiling code, packages the code to a jar, etc.
        // It is a build tool used for building and managing Java Based Projects (JBP)

        // Maven is based on the concept of POM (Project Object Model)
        // There are other build tools such as: Ant, Gradle, etc.
