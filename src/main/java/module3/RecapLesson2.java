    // When in an interview don't give wikipedia answers.
    // Example: What is regression testing? Don't say
    // "it is a way to check if functionality was broken after new features are integrated."
    // Regression is a very broad term, don't say it just handles checking for broken functionality after new things
    // are added. We need to be careful talking about it in interviews.

    // Say you have 30 test cases automated, and 50 total. If we run regression on the 30 of the automated
    // ones, can you say regression passed with 100% certainty?  NO.
    // There would be a 60% pass rate, but 40% test cases still need to be tested. We'd test them manually.
    // Those 20 test cases will be in the test bucket, waiting for automation.
    // Now that we ran our manual testing with our automation testing, we can say our automation passed 100%.
    // But automation is still 60% of our test cases. What do we call this?
    // We call it automation coverage.
    // We have 60% automation coverage. We still have 40% left to automate.

    // Regression can include multiple test strategies at one time. Don't think of it as only integration testing.
    // Let's say we executed a set of test cases that normally take 30 minutes to execute, but it's taking upwards
    // of 45 mins. That would be a red flag, we can see there is something wrong with performance.

    //  end-to-end testing can happen in regression too, and example would be on amazon checking the functionality
    // of filling out information and purchasing something. Not just integration testing.

    // Or let's say we have a 3rd party payment system, if it's included in the regression suite then we're
    // testing the integration of the payment system.



    // We're going to be using automation to read our test cases and tell us if they passed or not.
